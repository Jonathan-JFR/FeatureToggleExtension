FT-Extension is really simple to use. Just fill the URL pattern, the feature toggle and activate it.

Every time google chrome visit a website that match the pattern, the extension will add automatically a new param to the querystring including the feature toggle.

URL pattern do not support regex. It just check if the URL start with the pattern.
